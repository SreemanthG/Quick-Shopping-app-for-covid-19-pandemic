# About the app:
## Inspiration
in most of third world countries, people don't use online shopping, instead, they always have to walk to local stores and get what they need, which cannot be the best way ever to buy stuff, because they may not find what they want so fast and have to go to every store in order to get what they need, so I've built this app in order to make it easier for them to see the content of the nearby stores , which saves them time and effort.

## What it does
It shows people the details about the nearby stores or shops such as: the store's name, type, location and the products it has in stock, also lets store owners add and manage their stores in the app, they can update, delete their stores at any time.

## How I built it
I build it by creating a whole new project from scratch, after i had the idea and concept in my mind, i tried my best to convert the idea into reality. used new technologies that i didn't know before like firebase and non-relational database.

## Challenges I ran into
- Having to learn how to use google maps api.
- Finding the best ways to build the app with react without running into hard problems.
- Building the back-end with node.js and fixing bugs that causes the server to crash.
- Choosing between relational and non-relational database.(I've chosen none-relational db at last).
- Making the app look beautiful using the material-ui components.
- Fixing bugs that made me loose my sanity sometimes :)

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
- Being able to build a fullstack real world app by starting from scratch by using React for the front-end, nodejs for the backed and Firebase for the database and authentication

## What I learned
- Learned about google-maps-api and being able to know how to use it.
- Learned more about how to use React hooks.
- Learned non-relational database with firebase's cloud db.
- Learned how to make the app secure by using firebase's authentication system.
- Learned how to debug react and nodejs errors properly.

## What's next for Quick covid-19 shopping app
- Adding more features that can make the app more dynamic and useful.
- Porting the app to android and ios.
- Making the app's backend more powerful.
- Finding a team to develop the app even more and make it more ready to be used by everyone.
